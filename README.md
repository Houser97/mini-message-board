This project was made using node.js. The app allos the user to add a new message to the
message board, in which a username and text are required in a form the send the data.

The current app shows the abilities learned so far from the node section from The Odin Project course, which are the use of the express framework along with mongoose to define multiple routes using a router. Likewise, http verbs such as GET and POST are implemented to run the middleware functions that oversee the population of the messages area.
